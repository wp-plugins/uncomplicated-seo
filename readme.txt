= Why is the keyword-metatag not included? =

Because the main search eingines do not use it anymore for ranking purposes.

= How can I add a description for every single post/page? =

On every post and page, you should see a new textarea field where you can write the Description used for all the metatags. 
If no description is found, the site description will be used on the front page and the excerpt on single posts.
