Google Webmaster Tools, Google Plus and Bing Webmaster Tools, and insert
scripts/links in header and body (you can use that for Google Anaylitics

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is the keyword-metatag not included? =

Because the main search eingines do not use it anymore for ranking purposes.

= How can I add a description for every single post/page? =

In every post and page, you should see a new textarea field where you can write
the Description used for all the metatags. If no description is found, the
excerpt will be used as description. If there is no excerpt available, the site
description will be used.

= How can I upload a favicon? =

Use the normal WordPress Media Uploader. Once you have uploaded your icon, click
on the image. You will enter on the attachment details page, where you can see
an copy the url of the uploaded file.
